# Doc-ai

Documentor-AI is an intelligent document processing system that enables users to upload, search, and query documents (PDFs, TXT, DOCX, URLs) using AI-powered natural language understanding. Built with a React frontend and Flask backend, it leverages LangChain, OpenAI embeddings, and hybrid search (FAISS + BM25 + MMR) to deliver instant, accurate answers from large documents.
