Important:Article Summary
From the filing to quarterly estimated payments, there are several key IRS deadlines you should know about. Missing a tax deadline can result in penalties, so it’s essential to make sure you're filing and paying your taxes on time. Learn more about IRS tax deadlines, possible extensions, and other key dates you need to know as a taxpayer.

Important:Article Summary


Key Takeaways
When a significant natural disaster hits – such as a hurricane, earthquake, tornado, flood, wildfire, blizzard, or the like – the IRS will extend upcoming federal tax deadlines for affected taxpayers if a federal disaster is declared. The extended due dates apply to most federal tax returns and payments, including those for income taxes (including estimated tax payments), payroll taxes, and excise taxes. If you’re impacted by a natural disaster, check ourIRS Disaster Reliefpage to see if you qualify for an automatic tax filing or payment extension.

When are 2024 taxes due?
The due date for filing your federal income tax return is typically April 15 if you’re a calendar year filer. Generally, most individuals are calendar year filers.

When are 2024 taxes due?
For individuals, the last day to file your 2024 taxes without an extension is April 15, 2025. You can submit Form 4868 torequest an extensionto file later during the year.

When are 2024 taxes due?
If you have a business that operates on a fiscal year basis, your return is typically due on or before the 15th day of the third or fourth month (depending on the type of business entity) after the close of your fiscal year. In instances where this due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is moved to the next business day.

When are 2024 taxes due?
The last day to file your tax return isn’t the only important tax deadline to know, however. There are several other important upcoming tax deadlines you should know about. If you're wondering, "When are taxes due, anyway?" Here are the important dates at a glance.

TurboTax Tip:
If you’re not sure of how much you should pay in estimated taxes this year and you don't want to pay the wrong amount by accident, you can choose to pay 90% of your estimated current year tax bill or 100% (or 110% depending on AGI) of your prior year tax bill. This generally avoids needing to pay an underpayment penalty.

Businesses - Partnerships (including LLCs), C Corps (Form 1120), and S Corps (Form 1120S)
The above doesn't cover every tax deadline, merely the most important ones broadly relevant to these groups of taxpayers. For a comprehensive view of all theimportant tax deadlinesapplicable to each taxpayer, please visitIRS Publication 509.

What if I miss a tax deadline?
If you missed one of these key tax deadlines, you have options. Those options depend on what deadline was missed and whether you owe money or are due a refund.

What happens if you miss the tax filing deadline and are owed a refund?
If you overpaid for the 2024 tax year, there's typically no penalty for filing yourtax returnlate. However, you should file as soon as possible.

What happens if you miss the tax filing deadline and are owed a refund?
Generally, you have three years from the tax return due date to claim a tax refund. That means for 2024 tax returns (typically due in April of 2025), the window closes in 2028. After three years, unclaimed tax refunds typically become the property of the U.S. Treasury.

What happens if you miss the tax filing deadline and owe taxes?
When you miss a tax filing deadline and owe money to the IRS, you should file your tax return as soon as possible. Every day your tax return is delinquent, the IRS typically charges interest, failure to file penalties, and failure to pay penalties until you file your return and pay the balance due.

What happens if you miss an estimated tax payment deadline?
If you miss an estimated tax payment, make your payment as soon as you can. The penalties and interest the IRS charges depend on how much you owe and how late you are, but you can minimize the damage by making your payment as soon as possible.

What if I owe more than I can pay?
Don't put off filing just because you can't afford to pay the amount due on the day you need to file your tax return. The IRS starts charging penalties and interest on the day the return is due, no matter when you file. You can minimize failure-to-file penalties by filing as soon as possible, paying as much as you can when you file, and setting up an installment plan for the balance.

What's the fastest way to file my tax return?
The fastest and most accurate way to file your tax return is to file electronically.

What's the fastest way to file my tax return?
E-filing your tax return with the IRS is more secure than paper filing. Because the tax return is electronically transmitted to the IRS, you don't have to worry about it getting lost in the mail or arriving late. You'll also get confirmation right away that the IRS has received your return and has started processing it.

What's the fastest way to file my tax return?
If you're waiting for a tax refund, the fastest way to get your money is to have it electronically deposited into your bank account. The IRS typically issues 90% of refunds in fewer than 21 days when taxpayers combine direct deposit with electronic filing.

What if I need more time?
Don't let a looming tax deadline force you to rush through the tax filing process and make a mistake on your return. Simply request anextension.

What if I need more time?
The IRS typically grants a six-month extension of the tax filing deadline to anyone who requests it. You can request an extension electronically with TurboTax or useForm 4868.

What if I need more time?
Just keep in mind, the tax extension gives you more time to file your return, not more time to pay the tax you owe. You'll need to estimate the amount you owe and make your payment by the original tax filing deadline even if you file an extension.

What happens to my tax deadlines if I live in an area impacted by a natural disaster?
If you need more time because you live in an area hit by a natural disaster, you might qualify for tax relief from the IRS. The IRS often postpones the tax filing and payment deadline for taxpayers who live in or have a business within a federally declared disaster area.

What happens to my tax deadlines if I live in an area impacted by a natural disaster?
See ourIRS Disaster Reliefpage for more information on tax extensions for people and businesses impacted by recent natural disasters.

What if I made a mistake and need to re-file my taxes?
Mistakes happen. You file your tax return, then realize you forgot to report some income or claim a certain tax credit. You typically don't need to redo your whole return. Along with filing an amendment using Form 1040-X, you’ll also need to include copies of any forms and/or schedules that you’re changing or didn’t include with your original return.

What if I made a mistake and need to re-file my taxes?
IRS Form 1040-X is a two-page form used to amend a previously filed tax return. TurboTax can walk you through the amendment process to correct your tax return.

What if I made a mistake and need to re-file my taxes?
To avoid delays, make sure you only file Form 1040-X after your original Form 1040 has been accepted. If you’re filing a Form 1040-X to collect a tax credit or refund from a previous year, you’ll need to file within three years after the date you timely filed your original return, or within two years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later.

What is the last day to file taxes?
The last day to file taxes for individual federal income tax returns is usually April 15, unless this falls on a Saturday, Sunday or official holiday (even state-level holidays can extend the tax deadline). You can request a six-month extension by filing Form 4868, making your last day to file individual income taxes October 15, or the next business day if this is a weekend or holiday.

What is the last day to file taxes?
If you also file taxes for a small business that's taxed as a partnership or S corporation, the last day to file taxes is usually March 15. The standard deadline is April 15 for C corporations. However, once again, these deadlines can be extended if the due date falls on a weekend or official holiday. If your business runs on a non-calendar tax year, your federal tax return is generally due by the 15th day of either the third or fourth month following the end of the company's fiscal year, depending on the type of business.
